# Craters_MaskRCNN

AliDib_Catalogue.csv is the catalogue of Lunar craters predicted by the model in our test set (-180 to -60 Long). 

The python files are the inference code for the MaskRCNN craters identifier of Ali-Dib et al. 2020 (Icarus) used in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08826

The model weights, and some DEM examples, can be found here:

You need to download and untar the compressed file into the same directory and the python files.
